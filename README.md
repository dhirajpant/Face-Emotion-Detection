# Live Face Emotion Recognition

This project is a live face emotion recognition application built using Streamlit and TensorFlow. It captures video from your webcam, processes each frame to detect facial emotions, and displays the results in real-time.

## Features

- **Live Video Feed**: Captures video from the webcam and displays it in real-time within the Streamlit app.
- **Emotion Detection**: Uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model to predict emotions from facial expressions in real-time.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Simple and interactive web interface powered by Streamlit.
